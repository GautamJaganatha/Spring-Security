Spring Security JWT Authentication & Authorization with AngularJS.
This project demonstrates the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication and authorization using Spring Security in a Spring Boot backend and AngularJS as the frontend. 
It covers user registration (SignUp), login, and various CRUD operations, ensuring secure communication via JWT tokens.

Features:

User Registration (SignUp): Allows new users to register by providing necessary details. The user data is securely stored in the backend.

User Login: Authenticates users based on provided credentials and generates a JWT token.

JWT Token Generation: On successful login, a JWT token is generated and sent to the client.

Secure Communication: All subsequent requests from the client include the JWT token in the headers for authentication and authorization.

CRUD Operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations, with each request being authenticated via the JWT token.
